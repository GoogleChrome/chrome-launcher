# Chrome Flags for Tooling

Many tools maintain a list of runtime flags for Chrome to configure the environment. This file
is an attempt to document all chrome flags that are relevant to tools, automation, benchmarking, etc.

All use cases are different, so you'll have to choose which flags are most appropriate.

## Commonly unwanted browser features

* `--disable-client-side-phishing-detection`: Disables client-side phishing detection
* `--disable-component-extensions-with-background-pages`: Disable some built-in extensions that aren't affected by `--disable-extensions`
* `--disable-default-apps`: Disable installation of default apps
* `--disable-extensions`: Disable all chrome extensions
* `--mute-audio`: Mute any audio
* `--no-default-browser-check`: Disable the default browser check, do not prompt to set it as such
* `--no-first-run`: Skip first run wizards
* `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream`: Use fake device for Media Stream to replace camera and microphone
* `--use-file-for-fake-video-capture=<path-to-file>`: Use file for fake video capture (.y4m or .mjpeg) Needs `--use-fake-device-for-media-stream`
* `--disable-external-intent-requests`: Disallow opening links in external applications
* `--disable-features=Translate`: Disables Chrome translation, both the manual option and the popup prompt when a page with differing language is detected.

## Performance & web platform behavior

* `--allow-running-insecure-content`
* `--autoplay-policy=user-gesture-required`: Don't render video
* `--disable-background-timer-throttling`: Disable timers being throttled in background pages/tabs
* `--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows`: Normally, Chrome will treat a 'foreground' tab instead as _backgrounded_ if the surrounding window is occluded (aka visually covered) by another window. This flag disables that.
* `--disable-features=ScriptStreaming`: V8 script streaming
* `--disable-hang-monitor`: Suppresses hang monitor dialogs in renderer processes. This flag may allow slow unload handlers on a page to prevent the tab from closing.
* `--disable-ipc-flooding-protection`: Some javascript functions can be used to flood the browser process with IPC. By default, protection is on to limit the number of IPC sent to 10 per second per frame. This flag disables it. https://crrev.com/604305
* `--disable-notifications`: Disables the Web Notification and the Push APIs.
* `--disable-popup-blocking`: Disable popup blocking.  `--block-new-web-contents` is the strict version of this.
* `--disable-prompt-on-repost`: Reloading a page that came from a POST normally prompts the user.
* `--disable-renderer-backgrounding`: This disables non-foreground tabs from getting a lower process priority This doesn't (on its own) affect timers or painting behavior. [karma-chrome-launcher#123](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-chrome-launcher/issues/123)
* `--js-flags=--random-seed=1157259157`: Initialize V8's RNG with a fixed seed.

## Test & debugging flags

* `--enable-automation`: Disable a few things considered not appropriate for automation. ([Original design doc](https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1JYj9K61UyxIYavR8_HATYIglR9T_rDwAtLLsD3fbDQg/preview), though renamed [here](https://codereview.chromium.org/2564973002#msg24)) [codesearch](https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q=kEnableAutomation&type=cs). Note that some projects have chosen to **avoid** using this flag: [web-platform-tests/wpt/#6348](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/6348), [crbug.com/1277272](https://crbug.com/1277272)
  - sets `window.navigator.webdriver` to `true` within all JS contexts. This is also set [when using](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:content/child/runtime_features.cc;l=374-376;drc=4a843634b8b3006e431add55968f6f45ee54d35e) `--headless`, `--remote-debugging-pipe` and `--remote-debugging-port=0` (yes, [_specifically_ 0](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:content/child/runtime_features.cc;l=412-427;drc=4a843634b8b3006e431add55968f6f45ee54d35e)).
  - disables bubble notification about running development/unpacked extensions ([source](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/ui/extensions/extension_message_bubble_factory.cc;l=71-76;drc=1e6c1a39cbbc1dcad6e7828661d74d76463465ed))
  - disables the password saving UI (which [covers](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/password_manager/chrome_password_manager_client.cc;l=301-308;drc=1e6c1a39cbbc1dcad6e7828661d74d76463465ed) the usecase of the [removed](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromedriver/issues/detail?id=1015) `--disable-save-password-bubble` flag)
  - disables infobar animations ([source](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/infobars/content/content_infobar_manager.cc;l=48-52;drc=1e6c1a39cbbc1dcad6e7828661d74d76463465ed))
  - disables auto-reloading on network errors ([source](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:chrome/browser/chrome_content_browser_client.cc;l=1328-1331;drc=1e6c1a39cbbc1dcad6e7828661d74d76463465ed))
  - enables the CDP method [`Browser.getBrowserCommandLine`](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Browser/#method-getBrowserCommandLine).
  - avoids showing these 4 infobars: ShowBadFlagsPrompt, GoogleApiKeysInfoBarDelegate, ObsoleteSystemInfoBarDelegate, LacrosButterBar
  - adds this infobar: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39191/30349667-92a7a086-97c8-11e7-86b2-1365e3d407e3.png) ... which is known to [adversely affect screenshots](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1277272).
* `--enable-logging=stderr`: Logging behavior slightly more appropriate for a server-type process.
* `--log-level=0`: 0 means INFO and higher. `2` is the most verbose. Protip: Use `--enable-logging=stderr --v=2` and you may spot additional components active that you may want to disable.
* `--remote-debugging-pipe`: more secure than using protocol over a websocket
* `--remote-debugging-port=...`: With a value of 0, Chrome will automatically select a useable port _and_ will set `navigator.webdriver` to `true`.
* `--silent-debugger-extension-api`: Does not show an infobar when a Chrome extension attaches to a page using `chrome.debugger` page. Required to attach to extension background pages.
* `--test-type`: Basically the 2014 version of `--enable-automation`. [codesearch](https://cs.chromium.org/search/?q=kTestType%5Cb&type=cs)
  - It avoids creating application stubs in ~/Applications on mac.
  - It makes exit codes slightly more correct
  - windows navigation jumplists arent updated https://crbug.com/389375
  - doesn't start some chrome StartPageService
  - disables initializing chromecast service
  - "Component extensions with background pages are not enabled during tests because they generate a lot of background behavior that can interfere."
  - when quitting the browser, it disables additional checks that may stop that quitting process. (like unsaved form modifications or unhandled profile notifications..)
* `--deny-permission-prompts`: Suppress all permission prompts by automatically denying them.

## Chromium Annoyances

* `--password-store=basic`: Avoid potential instability of using Gnome Keyring or KDE wallet. [chromium/linux/password_storage.md](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/linux/password_storage.md) https://crbug.com/571003
* `--use-mock-keychain`: Use mock keychain on Mac to prevent the blocking permissions dialog asking: _Do you want the application “Chromium.app” to accept incoming network connections?_

## Rendering & GPU

* `--deterministic-mode`: An experimental meta flag. This sets the below indented flags which put the browser into a mode where rendering (border radius, etc) is deterministic and begin frames should be issued over DevTools Protocol. [codesearch](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:headless/app/headless_shell.cc;drc=df45d1abbc20abc7670643adda6d9625eea55b4d)

## Feature Flags FYI

Chromium and Blink use feature flags to disable/enable many features at runtime. Chromium has [~400 features](https://source.chromium.org/search?q=%22const%20base::Feature%22%20f:%5C.cc&sq=&ss=chromium%2Fchromium%2Fsrc) that can be toggled with `--enable-features` / `--disable-features`. https://niek.github.io/chrome-features/ presents all of them very clearly.


Independently, Blink has [many features](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:out/Debug/gen/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/runtime_enabled_features.cc;l=1969;drc=d6e91a65ded605d8577f0651b3665c8206ae6ce3) that can be toggled [with commandline switches](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/RuntimeEnabledFeatures.md#command_line-switches): `--enable-blink-features` / `--disable-blink-features`.
